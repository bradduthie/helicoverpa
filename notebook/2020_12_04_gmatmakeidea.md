calculate the G matrix by randoml assigning genetic values (vector in genome) to a large number of initialised individuals, then testing the fitness of each(selection). Do this after coming up with the fixed parts of the genome (which determine the map from genetic values to traits. So most constrained, there are N genetic values that need to be mapped to T traits. Randomly generate a mapping, then find the G matrix by testing a randomly initialised population of individuals with different genetic values given the mapping constraint. Given no constraint, G off diags are zerp?

Process sets a G matrix (all map from genes to traits) throws down gene values radonmly and gets traits for N individuals. Covariances among trait values *are* the valeues for the G matrix (simply make trait value fitness in the environment. This all can be done with the fixed map; G matrix can evolve, but this can be ignored at initialiseation -- it's separate. But the evolutionary algorithm is on the mapping until a correlation structure is satisfied. All individuals start with the same gene to trait mapping.  

===============

Suggest null hypothesis that evolutionary constraints are actually a consequence of a long chain of complex interactions from gene to phenotype. Maybe 'constraints' are constrained by physiology or biochemistry, but complexity?
