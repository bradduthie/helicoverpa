Brad Duthie is a theoretical biologist with a proven track record in modelling complex ecological and evolutionary systems (1-2). His previous research has included modelling evolutionary dynamics of inbreeding behaviour given complex genetic architectures and population pedigrees (3-5), ecological interactions among species on spatially explicit landscapes (6), and software development for modelling population management (7).
