three counts (land, biopesticide, pests)
allow movement for crop choice (move until find good habitat)
switch mating before or after dispersal
Sexual reproduction and recombination? (recombination necessary)
- Neutral alleles (look at inbreeding)


* Age
* Eat (adults don't eat). Larvae eat. Pupae don't eat or disperse or die)
* Move
* Reproduce
* Die


(susceptibility declines across larval instars)

egg -> larvae -> pupae -> adult

[moths]


No additive effects of biopesticide spray over taus (adults and pupae not affected by biopesticide)
